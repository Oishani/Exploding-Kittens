# Exploding Kittens

We desired to create an amazing, super awesome, fun quarantine game for our TA’s 
who must grade this project and anyone else bored in self-isolation! Our 
solution: ExPLoDiNG kiTTEnS!!!

We’re implementing a terminal-version of the popular card game “Exploding 
Kittens.” The game includes a special deck of cards which include cards such as 
“exploding kitten,” “defuse,” “skip,” “slap,” and “draw from the bottom.” The 
main goal of the game is to avoid drawing the “exploding kitten” card. Drawing 
this card “kills” the player who drew it and eliminates him/her from the game. 
Players are able to use other cards such as those listed above to avoid drawing 
the eliminating card. For an exhaustive list of rules of the game, please refer
